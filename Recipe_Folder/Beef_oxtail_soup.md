## Ingredients
Beef Oxtail\
Celery\
Carrots\
Potatoes\
Onions

# Dry Seasonings
Salt\
Black Pepper\
Star Anise\
Bay Leaves\
Peppercorn\
Garlic\
Ginger

## Instructions
1. Soak the beef oxtail in cold water to draw out the blood. Change the water a few times to keep the water clean. The first time I cooked this, I didn't soak the oxtail and I could see scum in the soup after cooking. The soup tasted a little sour, so maybe boiling the imperfections out will solve this.
2. Optional: Boil the beef oxtail for 20 minutes in a pot to remove impurities.
3. Optional: Rinse the beef oxtail under cold water to wash off the scum.
4. Oil the instant pot with olive oil. Place the beef oxtail in the pressure cooker and sear the meat.
5. Add vegetables, dry seasonings, and water in the pressure cooker. Add enough water to cover the meat, but not the veggies. The fat will leech out of the oxtail and create soup, so you don't need stock.
6. Set the pressure cooker to high and let it cook for 45 minutes. Allow the pressure cooker to naturally release. This will take 1.5 hours.
7. Let cool and store in plastic containers.

## Comments
12/7/2025: I added much more water to it this time because the soup was so good last time and I wanted to drink it longer. 
And exactly as expected, it diluted the flavor. The potatoes and carrots tasted less flavorful.
